This is a fully responsive frontend implementation of the **1MDM Seller Platform** as part of my internship assessment project. The goal is to build a clean, scalable, and mobile-friendly B2B medical equipment marketplace landing page using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 📱 Responsiveness

Every section is fully responsive and adapts to:

- **Mobile screens (≤ 640px)** – stacked layout, buttons full-width, center-aligned
- **Tablet screens (≤ 768px)** – optimized font sizes and spacing
- **Desktop (≥ 1024px)** – grid layouts, side-by-side components, hover effects

## 🎯 Notes

- Placeholder images used from `/assets`; in production, replace with real images from CDN or backend.
- Links like `/pricing.php` or `/contact.php` assumed to exist on the backend.
- Tailwind classes ensure smooth hover transitions, shadows, spacing, and typography.
